        Cross-Functional Magic: How to Unite Teams to Create Breakthrough
        Products
      </h1>

      <h2>
        In product management, one of the most critical — and often
        underestimated — skills is fostering collaboration between engineers,
        designers, and business teams.
      </h2>

      <p>
        These groups tend to think and operate differently, but when united,
        they can create products that are not just functional, but also
        delightful and aligned with market needs. However, getting them to work
        harmoniously is a delicate balancing act, one that product managers must
        master.
      </p>

      <h3>Embrace Diverse Perspectives</h3>
      <p>
        One of the first things to understand is that each team brings something
        invaluable to the table. Engineers often prioritize feasibility and
        efficiency, looking for scalable solutions. Designers are focused on
        user experience, aesthetic appeal, and ensuring that the product not
        only works but is delightful to use. Meanwhile, the business team’s
        focus is on market fit, revenue models, and scalability.
      </p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>
          “The key to bridging these perspectives is communication. It’s easy to
          get stuck in the weeds of technical jargon or business KPIs, but the
          goal is to create a shared language — one that allows all teams to
          understand not just their role, but how their efforts fit into the
          larger picture.”
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        In my journey at <span class="highlight">Enlight</span>, we had a
        cross-functional team of engineers, designers, and educators working on
        an offline learning management system. At first, the different teams had
        conflicting views about how to develop the system, but by holding
        regular cross-functional workshops, we made sure that everyone was
        aligned on both the user needs and the technical constraints.
      </p>

      <h3>Foster Empathy Through Transparency</h3>
      <p>
        Too often, engineers, designers, and business teams operate in silos,
        which can lead to frustration and inefficiency. One of the best ways to
        mitigate this is to make sure each team understands the pressures and
        priorities of the other.
      </p>

      <h3>Collaboration is a Two-Way Street</h3>
      <p>
        As a product manager, it’s tempting to think your role is simply to
        translate between teams. While that’s part of the job, it’s more
        important to encourage direct collaboration between team members.
      </p>

      <h3>It's All About the End-User</h3>
      <p>
        At the end of the day, all teams — engineers, designers, and business
        leaders — have one thing in common: they want the product to succeed.
